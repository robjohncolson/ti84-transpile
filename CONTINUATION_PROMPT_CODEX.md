# Continuation Prompt — TI-84 Plus CE ROM Transpilation

**Last updated**: 2026-04-10T19:30Z
**Focus**: Continue the TI-84 Plus CE ROM to JavaScript transpilation effort
**Current phase**: Phases 1-24B complete. Coverage at 16.5% (124327 blocks). Zero live stubs. Reset vector executes to HALT (62 steps). ISR dispatch gate UNLOCKED — IM1 handler reaches callback dispatch at 0x000710 for the first time. Function call harness working (FPAdd/Mult/Div/Sin). 24-bit CPU registers. Keyboard port 0x01 wired. 45 new seeds from ISR exploration.

---

## What Was Completed (Phases 7-19)

### Phase 7: I/O Peripheral Model (complete)

**Created `TI-84_Plus_CE/peripherals.js`:**
- Factory function `createPeripheralBus(options)` returns `{ read, write, register, getState }`
- `register(portOrRange, handler)` — supports single port, array range, or object range
- Unregistered ports return 0xFF (preserves legacy behavior)
- Optional `trace` mode logs all I/O to console

**Built-in peripheral handlers:**
- **PLL Controller (port 0x28)**: Returns 0x00 until configured (first write), then returns 0x00 for `pllDelay` reads (default 2), then returns 0x04 (bit 2 set = PLL locked). Repeated writes of the same config value do NOT reset the delay counter.
- **CPU Control Register (port 0x00)**: Read/write register, default 0x00
- **GPIO Port (port 0x03)**: Configurable read value (default 0xFF = no buttons), stores writes
- **Flash Controller (port 0x06)**: Returns 0xD0 (hardware ready status — unlocks ISR gate at 0x000704), stores writes
- **Keyboard Scan (port 0x01)**: Write selects key group (active low), read returns key status. **NOTE: Port 0x01 is NOT used for keyboard reads on the CE — keyboard is MMIO at 0xF50000+. Port 0x01 writes are only used during boot/shutdown config.**
- **Timer/Counter ports (0x10-0x18)**: Returns 0x00, stores writes

**Modified `TI-84_Plus_CE/cpu-runtime.js`:**
- `createExecutor(blocks, memory, options = {})` — new third parameter
- `options.peripherals` wired into `cpu._ioRead`/`cpu._ioWrite` BEFORE tracing hooks (so tracing still works)

**Key finding — PLL loop is interrupt-driven:**
- ROM code at 0x000697: `out0 (0x28), a` → `in0 a, (0x28)` → `bit 2, a` → `jr nc, 0x000690`
- `bit 2, a` sets Z flag but NOT carry flag
- `jr nc` checks carry — which is never modified in this loop
- The loop is designed to exit via interrupt (NMI or timer), not via PLL register value
- Force-breaker at `maxLoopIterations` remains the correct workaround until interrupt dispatch is implemented

### Phase 8: Multi-Entry-Point Execution (complete)

Added Test 5 to `test-harness.mjs` — 14 entry points tested without block trace (quiet mode):

| Entry Point | Steps | Termination | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------------|-------|
| RST 0x08-0x38 (7 handlers) | 4-13 | halt | All reach power-down at 0x0019b5 |
| OS entry 0x020110 | 4 | halt | Power-down |
| Mid-ROM 0x4000 | 2 | missing_block | Wild jump to 0x7eedf3 (uninitialized regs) |
| Mid-ROM 0x21000 | 5000 | max_steps | Deep execution, reaches 0x08278d |
| Post-vector 0x100 | 4 | missing_block | Wild jump to 0xc202fe |
| ADL startup 0x658 | 5000 | max_steps | PLL loop (59 forced breaks) |
| Region 0x800 | 5000 | max_steps | PLL loop |
| Region 0x1afa | 5000 | max_steps | PLL loop |

**Key: 8/14 reach HALT, 4 run to max_steps (3 PLL-stuck, 1 deep), 2 hit missing blocks.**

### Phase 9A: Coverage Expansion (complete)

- Block limit raised: 32768 → 65536
- Added 30 new seed entry points:
  - ISR handlers: 0x000040-0x000068 (6 entries)
  - OS jump table: 0x020008-0x020040 (8 entries)
  - Mid-ROM functions: 0x004100, 0x004200, 0x005000, 0x008000, 0x010000
  - Graphics/display: 0x021100, 0x021200, 0x021400
  - Upper ROM: 0x050000-0x0C0000 (5 entries)
- Reachability exhausted at 50307 blocks (didn't hit 64K ceiling)
- Coverage: 5.20% → 7.54%

### Phase 10A: Missing Block Discovery (complete)

**Modified executor `runFrom()` in cpu-runtime.js:**
- `onMissingBlock(pc, mode, steps)` callback
- Skip-ahead: when block is missing, tries pc+1 through pc+16 for next valid block
- `missingBlocks` Set collected and returned with results
- Discovery summary aggregates all missing blocks across all tests

**Modified test-harness.mjs:**
- All tests and multi-entry runs now collect `onMissingBlock` data
- Discovery Summary section at the end reports unique missing addresses
- Result: only 2 dynamic missing targets (0x7eedf3, 0xc202fe — both wild jumps)

### Phase 10B: Coverage Gap Analysis (complete)

**Created `TI-84_Plus_CE/coverage-analyzer.mjs`:**
- Standalone analysis script, no dependencies
- 16KB-region heatmap (non-zero regions only)
- Top 20 uncovered gaps ranked by size
- Suggested new seed entry points from largest OS-area gaps
- Summary: gaps >1KB, gaps >10KB, OS vs data area coverage

**Key findings:**
- OS area (0x000000-0x0FFFFF): **30.22% covered** (316,833 bytes)
- Data area (0x100000+): **~0% covered** (27 bytes) — not code
- Largest OS-area gaps: 0x0DCDC6-0x0FDD02 (135KB), 0x0C0001-0x0D2AFC (77KB)
- 10 suggested seeds from gap analysis

### Phase 10C: Feed-Forward Seeds (complete)

- Added 10 OS-area seed entry points from coverage gap analysis
- Pruned 3 data-area seeds (0x100000, 0x200000, 0x300000) that produced 0% code
- Result: +76 blocks, +657 bytes — minimal gain, frontier truly exhausted

### Phase 11A: Indirect Jump Instrumentation (complete)

**Modified cpu-runtime.js `runFrom()`:**
- `blockVisits` Map tracks per-block visit counts (hot block profiling)
- `dynamicTargets` Set collects PCs reached via non-static exits (indirect jumps/returns)
- `onDynamicTarget(targetPc, mode, fromPc, step)` callback
- Both included in return objects

**Modified test-harness.mjs:**
- Multi-entry runs collect dynamic targets
- Discovery Summary reports both missing blocks AND dynamic jump targets
- Hot Blocks section shows top 15 most-visited blocks from Test 4

**First feedback loop iteration:**
- 72 dynamic jump targets discovered (dense jump table at 0x082xxx from 0x021000 execution)
- All 70 valid targets were already statically reachable — 0 new blocks
- Confirms static analysis is comprehensive within reachable frontier

### Phase 11B: Stub Elimination (complete)

**Decoder fixes in `decodeInstruction()`:**
- Doubled index prefix consumption: `FD DD` / `DD FD` → skip first, second prefix wins
- Extended ED NOP fallback: undefined opcodes DD/FD/CB/ED/C0+ range/EE/77/94 → 2-byte NOP

**Emitter fixes in `emitInstructionJs()`:**
- `nop` tag handler for manual decoder NOPs (was falling through to unimplemented)
- `sbc a, immediate` pattern (was only `sbc a, register`)
- `out (n), a` pattern with malformed `0x0x` hex normalization
- `.sil`/`.sis`/`.lil`/`.lis` suffix stripping from z80js mnemonics before regex matching

**Results:** Stubs went 3 → 25 (new paths discovered) → 0 (all fixed). +105 blocks from newly reachable code.

### Phase 12: Post-HALT Wake + Executor Wake Support (complete)

**12A: Wake continuation tests in test-harness.mjs:**
- Test 6: NMI wake from 0x0066 with post-boot state (50K steps)
- Test 7: IM1 wake from 0x0038 with post-boot state
- Finding: NMI handler re-enters startup/PLL sequence (no new code regions). IM1 re-halts in 4 steps.
- Dynamic targets from wake: all already known (72 unique)

**12B: Executor wake support in cpu-runtime.js:**
- `wakeFromHalt` option in `runFrom()`: 'nmi' (0x0066), 'im1'/'true' (0x0038), or custom `{vector, returnPc, mode}`
- Fires once then clears (prevents infinite HALT→wake loops)
- `onWake(haltPc, wakePc, mode)` callback

**12 Finding: Deep execution from 0x021000** — 100K steps, 75 dynamic targets, 0 missing blocks, 0 loops forced. Static frontier is completely saturated.

### Phase 13A: Complete eZ80 Instruction Decoder (complete)

**Created `TI-84_Plus_CE/ez80-decoder.js` (784 lines):**

Table-driven decoder to replace the z80js npm dependency. Produces structured instruction objects with typed tags (no mnemonic text parsing needed).

**Covered instruction groups:**
- Unprefixed opcodes (256 entries): LD, ALU, INC/DEC, PUSH/POP, JP/JR/CALL/RET, RST, rotates, misc
- CB prefix: BIT/SET/RES/rotate for all 8 registers + (HL)
- DD/FD prefix: IX/IY indexed loads/stores/ALU, half-registers (IXH/IXL/IYH/IYL), indexed bit ops (DD CB d op), doubled-prefix consumption (FD DD → DD wins)
- ED prefix: IN0/OUT0, IN/OUT (C), SBC/ADC HL, LD rr/(nn), NEG, RETN/RETI, IM, block transfer (LDI/LDIR/etc), eZ80-specific (LEA, TST, MLT, STMIX, RSMIX, SLP, OTIMR, LD IX/IY/(HL))
- eZ80 mode prefixes: .SIS/.LIS/.SIL/.LIL affect immediate width
- Undefined ED opcodes → 2-byte NOP

**INTEGRATED in Phase 13B** — decoder wired into transpiler, z80js removed.

---

### Phase 13B: Integrate Decoder into Transpiler (complete)

Replaced `scripts/transpile-ti84-rom.mjs` (2128→830 lines):
- Removed z80js dependency entirely
- Imported `decodeInstruction` from `ez80-decoder.js`
- Added `buildDasm()` for human-readable disassembly strings in comments
- Added adapter function that maps decoder output to buildBlock-compatible format (kind, targetMode, condition, etc.)
- Replaced regex-heavy `emitInstructionJs()` with direct tag dispatch (~50 handlers, zero regex)
- Fixed decoder bugs: IN0/OUT0 register tables (0x30/0x31 shadowed eZ80 LD IX/IY,(HL)), DD/FD→ED forwarding

### Phase 14: Interrupt Dispatch Model (complete)

**Modified `TI-84_Plus_CE/peripherals.js`:**
- Added interrupt controller state: `timerPending`, `nmiPending`, counter, interval
- Timer fires IRQ or NMI every N blocks (configurable `timerInterval`, `timerMode`)
- Methods: `tick()`, `hasPendingIRQ()`, `hasPendingNMI()`, `acknowledgeIRQ()`, `acknowledgeNMI()`, `triggerNMI()`, `triggerIRQ()`
- Added interrupt status register (port 0x3D) returning 0x00 — NMI handler at 0x0066 takes alternate path
- Added interrupt acknowledge register (port 0x3E)

**Modified `TI-84_Plus_CE/cpu-runtime.js`:**
- After each block: `peripherals.tick()` → check NMI (non-maskable) → check IRQ (if IFF1)
- NMI dispatch: push PC, save IFF1→IFF2, clear IFF1, jump to 0x0066
- IRQ dispatch: push PC, clear IFF1/IFF2, jump to IM1 (0x0038) or IM2 (vector table)
- HALT wake: check NMI/IRQ before terminating, dispatch interrupt to wake CPU
- `onInterrupt(type, fromPc, vector, step)` callback

**Key finding — NMI handler branching:**
- Port 0x3D = 0xFF (old): NMI handler re-enters startup (infinite cycle)
- Port 0x3D = 0x00 (new): NMI handler takes alternate path (0x000047 → call 0x0008BB → halt)

### Phase 15: DD/FD Prefix Passthrough (complete)

- DD/FD prefix on non-IX/IY opcodes now executes the opcode as-is (DD consumed silently)
- Example: DD 2F = CPL (was NOP), DD AF = XOR A (was NOP)
- Stacked prefix bytes (DD DD, FD FD) still treated as NOP
- Added DD/FD→ED forwarding in decodeDDFD (DD ED xx decoded as ED instruction)
- Block count decreased from 50533 to 50369 due to corrected instruction lengths

### Phase 16: CPU Completeness + Deep Profiling (complete)

**16A: Added missing CPU methods:**
- `cpd()` / `cpdr()` — block compare with decrement (mirrors cpi/cpir)

**16B: Deep execution profiling (0x021000, 100K steps):**
- Created `TI-84_Plus_CE/deep-profile.mjs`
- 0x021000 → JP 0x09BF16 → OS dispatch loop at 0x082000
- 210 steps to halt (NMI triggers at step 200, handler halts)
- 50 dynamic targets discovered (all in 0x082xxx jump table)
- 0 missing blocks — static analysis covers all reachable code
- 94 blocks visited in 0x082000 region (OS jump table dispatch)
- 11 active 4KB regions across the ROM

**16C: Block I/O instructions added:**
- Decoder: INI, IND, INIR, INDR, OUTI, OUTD, OTIR, OTDR (ED prefix)
- CPU: ini(), ind(), outi(), outd(), inir(), indr(), otir(), otdr()
- Emitter: direct tag handlers for all 8 block I/O tags

### Phase 22: OS Jump Table + Mass Seeding (complete/in-flight)

**22A: OS jump table discovery:**
- Jump table at 0x020104+: 980 entries, each a JP instruction to the actual implementation
- ALL core math transpiled: FPAdd (0x07C77F), FPMult (0x07C8B7), FPDiv (0x07CAB9), SqRoot (0x07DF66), Sin (0x07E57B), Cos (0x07E5B5), Tan (0x07E5D8), ASin, ACos, ATan, EToX, LnX, LogX, TenX, Round
- Statistics: OneVar (0x0A9325), OrdStat (0x0AAAB8), InitStatAns (0x0AB21B)
- Math implementations live at 0x07C000-0x07F000, statistics at 0x0A9000-0x0AB000

**22B: OS jump table seed expansion:**
- Added 170 seeds for missing jump table implementations → 56928 blocks, 100% jump table coverage
- +6443 blocks, +37539 bytes

**22C: Prologue-scan seeding:**
- Scanned uncovered OS regions for function prologue patterns (PUSH IX/IY, PUSH AF+BC, etc.)
- Added 2025 seeds + 256-byte interval seeds in large gaps (0x0C0000-0x0FFFFF, 0x016000-0x01FFFF)
- Result: 68774 blocks → 110141 blocks (+41367), coverage 10.36% → 15.63%
- OS area coverage: ~41% → ~62%

**22D: Dense gap-fill seeding (COMPLETE):**
- Added 18908 seeds at 32-byte intervals in ALL remaining uncovered gaps > 64 bytes
- Block limit raised to 200000
- Result: 124327 blocks, 692278 bytes, 16.5% coverage
- Seed count: 21229

**Key finding — ROM.transpiled.js exceeded GitHub 100MB limit at 175MB.**
- File is now gitignored
- Generate locally: `node scripts/transpile-ti84-rom.mjs`
- All seeds are in the transpiler script; regeneration is deterministic

### Phase 23: Function Call Harness (complete)

**Created `TI-84_Plus_CE/ti84-math.mjs`:**
- Clean API for calling OS math functions: `callFunction(addr, { op1, op2 })`
- TI float format: 9 bytes, BCD encoded (sign, exponent, 7 mantissa pairs)
- Calling convention: OP1 at 0xD005F8, OP2 at 0xD00601, result in OP1
- 16MB memory (`new Uint8Array(0x1000000)`) with ROM loaded
- 24-bit CPU registers (BC/DE/HL have full 24-bit backing stores)
- Timer interrupts disabled for clean function execution
- Working functions: FPAdd (0x07C77F), FPMult (0x07C8B7), FPDiv (0x07CAB9), Sin (0x07E57B)
- Sentinel return address (0xFFFFFF) for clean function exit detection

### Phase 24A: ISR Dispatch Gate Unlocked (complete)

**The problem:** IM1 handler at 0x000038 reads port 0x06 (flash status) into A, then compares A with 0xD0 at block 0x000704. With port returning 0x00, the CP 0xD0 always failed → JP NZ to power-down. Block 0x000710 (callback dispatch) was unreachable.

**The fix:** Flash port 0x06 returns 0xD0 (hardware ready status). Boot code reads port 0x06 but only to SET bit 2 and write back — never branches on the value. 0xD0 has bit 2 = 0, so the BIT 2 test gives Z=1 → JR Z taken → direct to CP gate → 0xD0 == 0xD0 → gate passes → falls through to 0x000710.

**Key block analysis:**
- Block 0x0006FA: `LD A, 0x03` / `OUT0 (0x06), A` / `CP 0x03` / `JR Z, 0x000704` — the "flash busy" path that kills A. Taken when bit 2 of port 0x06 is set.
- Block 0x000710: `LD HL, (0xD02AD7)` / `PUSH HL` / `CALL 0x001713` — callback dispatch. Reads 24-bit callback address from RAM.

**Added keyboard scan port 0x01:**
- Write: selects key group (active low bit pattern)
- Read: returns key status for selected groups (0xFF = no keys pressed)
- 8-group matrix with AND logic for simultaneous group scanning
- Exposed via `peripherals.keyboard` for test simulation

**Test results:**
- Test 9: Boot I/O trace confirms port 0x06 reads 0xD0 throughout
- Test 10: ISR reaches 0x000710 (46 steps), visits 35 unique blocks across 3 code regions

### Phase 24B: ISR Post-Dispatch Exploration (complete)

**Test 11 (Deep ISR with callback table):** Initialized 0xD02AD7 → 0x0019BE (OS event loop). ISR dispatches through callback but still HALTs at power-down (46 steps, 35 blocks, 3 regions).

**Test 12 (OS Event Loop at 0x0019BE):** Direct entry with OS-like state (IY=0xD00080, bit 6 set). 239 steps, 39 blocks, 2 regions. Event loop checks system flags and falls through to power-down.

**Test 13 (ROM handler table scan):** Scanned ISR handler area (0x700-0x800), OS dispatch table (0x20100-0x20200), RST vector area (0x38-0x70) for 24-bit pointers. Handler 0x08C331 runs 1000+ steps into deep OS code. Handler 0x061DB6 reaches new block at 0x00586A.

**Seeds:** 45 unique addresses written to `TI-84_Plus_CE/phase24b-seeds.txt`.

### Phase 24C: Deep Handler Exploration + Callback Table Research (complete)

**Test 14 (Deep handler 0x08C331):** Major OS initialization routine. 691 steps, 162 unique blocks across 10 code regions (0x00-0x0A). Made 262,936 RAM writes. **Writes to callback pointer at 0xD02AD7** at step 690 (0xFF bytes). Accesses interrupt controller (port 0x5004/5005) and port 0x3114. Heavy activity in 0x0A0000 region (59 blocks — statistics/data area) and 0x050000 (32 blocks).

**Test 15 (Handler probes):**
- 0x06ACB2 (reached by 0x08C331): 256 steps, 56 blocks — deep OS subsystem
- 0x07C897: 245 steps, 45 blocks — math library
- 0x0019B6 (ISR missing block): 240 steps, 39 blocks — ISR continuation path
- 0x00586A: still a missing block (needs seeding)

**Test 16 (Boot memory trace):** Only 6 RAM writes during 62-step boot. Callback table NOT initialized during boot (0xD02AD7 = 0x000000). System vars and FP area all zeroed.

**Test 17 (ISR cycling) — key discovery:** The callback pointer evolves across ISR cycles:
- Cycle 0: boot → callback = 0x000000
- Cycle 1: ISR → callback changes to 0x000010
- Cycle 2: 271 steps → callback changes to **0x0040B2** (real OS handler address!)
- Cycle 3: hits missing block at **0x00AFF7**, blocking further progress
- The ISR is self-modifying its dispatch table — each interrupt cycle updates the callback pointer

**Seeds:** 55 new Phase 24C seeds appended to phase24b-seeds.txt (100 total in file).

### Phase 24D: Pre-initialized Callback + Keyboard Simulation (complete)

**Test 18 (Pre-initialized callback):** OS init at 0x08C331 writes **0xFFFFFF** (sentinel) to 0xD02AD7 — not a useful callback target. Running OS init before boot corrupts RAM, causing boot to loop at PLL (5000 steps, max_steps). ISR cycling after corrupted boot hits missing block 0x000698 repeatedly.

**Test 19 (Keyboard interrupt):** No keyboard port 0x01 accesses during ISR — the keyboard scan routine is not in the current execution path. Key press (ENTER) makes zero difference to ISR behavior. The keyboard scan code lives deeper in the OS event loop, which requires more blocks to be transpiled.

**Test 20 (Handler 0x0040B2):** This address is itself a **missing block** — only 3 steps before hitting missing_block. It needs to be seeded and transpiled.

**Critical missing blocks identified:**
- **0x0040B2**: ISR cycling target (callback pointer evolved to this address) — NOT TRANSPILED
- **0x000698**: PLL loop continuation block, adjacent to hot block 0x000697 — NOT TRANSPILED

**Seeds:** 4 new Phase 24D seeds. 82 total Phase 24 seeds added to transpiler. Transpiler regeneration in progress.

### Phase 24E: Re-transpile + Keyboard Breakthrough (complete)

Re-transpiled with 0x0040B2 + 0x000698 seeds: 124367 blocks (+2).

**Test 19 breakthrough:** With new blocks, keyboard interrupt simulation now runs **100,000 steps** with **452 keyboard port 0x01 accesses**! All accesses are OUTs (group select writes with value 0x00). No INs (reads) captured yet — the keyboard read path may use a different mechanism or the reads happen through memory-mapped I/O.

**Test 15 improvement:** Handler 0x00586A (previously missing block) now runs 232 steps to HALT.

**Test 17 unchanged:** ISR cycling still reaches callback 0x0040B2 at cycle 4, runs 293 steps at cycle 6.

**Test 18 still blocked:** 0x000698 shows in missing blocks list despite being seeded — the seed may have produced an empty/invalid block.

**Key insight:** The OS keyboard scan code IS executing (452 port writes). The next step is understanding why reads aren't being captured — likely a port width issue (keyboard reads may use 16-bit port addressing) or the reads go through IN r,(C) which uses BC as the port address.

### Phase 19: Peripheral Audit + OS Wake Analysis (complete)

**19A: Port I/O audit:**
- Traced port reads across 4 entry points (0x000000, 0x021000, 0x000658, 0x0012CA) at 10K steps each
- Result: **zero unregistered port reads**. All reads go to registered handlers (GPIO 0x03, flash 0x06, PLL 0x28)
- The OS boot completes normally in 18 steps (post-PLL) and enters power-down HALT at 0x0019B5

**19B: IRQ wake analysis:**
- IM1 handler at 0x000038: saves registers (EX AF/EXX, push IX/IY), loads IY=0xD00080 (OS system vars), JP 0x0006F3
- 0x0006F3: checks flash status (port 0x06 bit 2). If flash ready → 0x000704
- 0x000704: sets system flag (IY+27 bit 6), checks if A=0xD0 for interrupt dispatch
- If A≠0xD0 → power-down. If A=0xD0 → 0x000710 (reads callback address from RAM at 0xD02AD7, calls 0x001713)
- **Current behavior**: A=0x00 (flash returns 0x00), so handler always re-enters power-down
- **To unlock deeper interrupt handling**: need A=0xD0 at the CP check, which requires modeling a hardware interrupt source register

**Key finding — OS execution flow:**
1. Boot: DI → PLL init → hardware setup → RST 0x08 → init function → power-down HALT
2. IRQ wake: EX AF/EXX → check flash → set flag → CP 0xD0 → power-down (no dispatch)
3. NMI wake: check port 0x3D → if 0x00: call 0x0008BB → quick return → HALT

### Phase 18: Flag Accuracy + Dead Code Cleanup (complete)

**18A: INC/DEC flag updates:**
- Added `inc8(value)` / `dec8(value)` to CPU class with proper S/Z/H/PV/N flags (C preserved)
- Updated emitter: INC r, DEC r, INC (HL), DEC (HL), INC (IX+d), DEC (IX+d)

**18B: CALL return address:**
- Verified the emitter was already correct (`cpu.push(fallthrough); return target;`)
- Removed dead `cpu.call()` method with stale BUG comment

**18C: OR/XOR flag fix:**
- Added `updateOrXorFlags()` (H=0) separate from `updateLogicFlags()` (H=1, for AND)
- Updated emitter: OR/XOR now use `updateOrXorFlags`, AND uses `updateLogicFlags`

**18D: CPL and accumulator rotate flags:**
- CPL now sets H=1, N=1
- RLCA/RRCA/RLA/RRA now set X/Y (bits 3/5) from result

## Important Constraints

### This repo is already dirty

There are many unrelated modified files in the worktree. Do not revert them.

### This is still a lift, not a handwritten rewrite

Stay with the 1:1-ish bytecode-lift direction:

- widen decoder support
- improve control-flow discovery
- improve emitted instruction semantics
- add runtime helpers only to support executing lifted blocks

Do not replace this with a high-level emulator rewrite unless the user explicitly changes direction.

## How To Regenerate

From repo root (no dependencies needed):

```bash
node scripts/transpile-ti84-rom.mjs
```

Full validation:

```bash
node TI-84_Plus_CE/test-harness.mjs
node TI-84_Plus_CE/coverage-analyzer.mjs
```

## Phase 25 Summary (2026-04-11)

### Browser Shell (browser-shell.html)
- ROM.transpiled.js.gz (15MB) committed to repo, decompressed via DecompressionStream on Boot
- Keyboard input: ti84-keyboard.js maps PC keys → TI-84 matrix (SDK keypadc.h authoritative)
- LCD rendering: ti84-lcd.js decodes BGR565 from VRAM at 0xD40000 via ImageData
- AutoRun mode with requestAnimationFrame loop
- NMI timer required (`timerMode: 'nmi'`) — boot ends with IFF=0, only NMI can wake CPU

### Keyboard Mapping (CRITICAL CORRECTION)
**MMIO at 0xE00810 uses REVERSED group ordering vs SDK kb_Data at 0xF50010:**
```
keyMatrix[N] = SDK Group(7-N)
```
Full verified mapping:
- keyMatrix[0] = SDK G7: DOWN(B0) LEFT(B1) RIGHT(B2) UP(B3)
- keyMatrix[1] = SDK G6: ENTER(B0) +(B1) -(B2) ×(B3) ÷(B4) ^(B5) CLEAR(B6)
- keyMatrix[2] = SDK G5: (-)(B0) 3(B1) 6(B2) 9(B3) )(B4) TAN(B5) VARS(B6)
- keyMatrix[3] = SDK G4: .(B0) 2(B1) 5(B2) 8(B3) ((B4) COS(B5) PRGM(B6) STAT(B7)
- keyMatrix[4] = SDK G3: 0(B0) 1(B1) 4(B2) 7(B3) ,(B4) SIN(B5) APPS(B6) XTθn(B7)
- keyMatrix[5] = SDK G2: STO(B1) LN(B2) LOG(B3) x²(B4) x⁻¹(B5) MATH(B6) ALPHA(B7)
- keyMatrix[6] = SDK G1: GRAPH(B0) TRACE(B1) ZOOM(B2) WINDOW(B3) Y=(B4) 2ND(B5) MODE(B6) DEL(B7)

Scan code = `(keyMatrix_index << 4) | bit`. 63/64 positions active. DOWN(G0:B0) = 0x00 (indistinguishable from no-key).

**Phase 24F labels were WRONG** — scan codes were correct but key names were guessed. The SDK from ce-programming/toolchain is the authoritative source.

### _GetCSC (0x03CF7D) — ISR Exit Code, NOT a Scanner
ROM disassembly of handler at 0x03D184-0x03D1BB revealed:
1. Acknowledges keyboard IRQ (OUT to port 0x500A)
2. Disables keyboard IRQ in enable mask (port 0x5006)
3. Overwrites callback pointer at 0xD02AD7
4. Clears (IY+27) bit 6 system flag
5. Returns via RETI (expects ISR stack frame)
**Never reads keyboard MMIO.** A=0x10 return was stale register, not a scan code.

### Direct Keyboard Scan (0x0159C0) — WORKING
- Sets IY=0xE00800, reads MMIO scan result at 0xE00900
- Returns scan code in B register (NOT A)
- Test 25: 9/9 PASS for all tested keys
- Must capture B at block 0x015AD2 (before exit path corrupts registers)
- Timer must be disabled (`timerInterrupt: false`), IFF1=0

### OS Event Loop — Blocked at 0x00B608
- Pre-initialized callback (0xD02AD7 = 0x0019BE) + system flags works
- ISR reaches event loop at 0x0019BE (18 steps)
- Cycling hits missing block 0x00B608 every cycle
- Seeds 0xB608/B610/B620/B640 added, retranspile in progress

## What Is Still Missing / Next Frontiers

Coverage at 124327 blocks (16.5%). ISR gate is unlocked. Function call harness works. The remaining frontiers are about making the OS event loop functional and rendering output.

### 1. Wire Keyboard MMIO at 0xF50000 (highest priority — Phase 24F)

**DISCOVERY: The TI-84 CE keyboard is memory-mapped, NOT port I/O.**

Port 0x01 is irrelevant for keyboard reads. The keyboard uses MMIO at:
- `0xF50000` — keyboard data register (4 ROM references)
- `0xF50007` — keyboard control
- `0xF5000E` — keyboard config (2 references)
- `0xF50018` — keyboard status

ROM functions that access keyboard MMIO (ALL already transpiled):
- `0x0061C2` — keyboard data read (0xF50000)
- `0x0061E9` — keyboard data read (0xF50000)
- `0x000791` — keyboard config (0xF5000E)
- `0x00142C` — keyboard control (0xF50007)
- `0x0016C3` — keyboard config (0xF5000E)
- `0x028116` — keyboard data (0xF50000)
- `0x049F25` — keyboard data (0xF50000)
- `0x07B241` — keyboard status (0xF50018)

The blocks exist but aren't reached during execution because the ISR call chain breaks at missing blocks before reaching the keyboard scan code.

**BREAKTHROUGH: _GetCSC keyboard handler found and working:**
- `_GetCSC` is jump table entry 2 → 0x03CF7D
- It reads port 0x5016 (interrupt controller masked status byte 2)
- If bit 3 set (= bit 19 of full status), it jumps to 0x03D184 (keyboard handler)
- The handler runs through 0x03D184 → 0x03D197 → 0x03D19C → 0x03D1BB
- Returns scan code in A register (A=0x10 when tested)
- The keyboard handler reads port 0x5006 (intc enable mask) and port 0x0003 (GPIO) — NOT the keyboard matrix directly
- To trigger: set bit 3 of port 0x5016 response (inject via _ioRead hook, or set rawStatus bit 19 + enableMask bit 19)

### Phase 24F: Keyboard MMIO Handler (MILESTONE)

**DISCOVERY: Keyboard hardware is at 0xE00800, not 0xF50000.**

The TI-84 CE keyboard controller is memory-mapped at 0xE00800-0xE00920:
- `0xE00803` — scan mode register
- `0xE00807` — scan enable
- `0xE00808` — scan column
- `0xE0080F` — scan interval
- `0xE00810-0xE00817` — key data per group (8 groups × 8 keys, active low)
- `0xE00818` — status (bit 1 = scan complete)
- `0xE00824` — ready flag (bit 0 = result available)
- `0xE00900` — scan result byte (computed from key matrix)

**Keyboard scan function at 0x0159C0:**
- Initializes scan hardware (IY=0xE00800)
- Reads scan result from 0xE00900
- Waits for ready flag at 0xE00824 bit 0
- Returns scan code in B register

**Verified scan codes:**
| Key | Group | Bit | Scan Code |
|-----|-------|-----|-----------|
| No key | — | — | 0x00 |
| ENTER | 6 | 0 | 0x60 |
| CLEAR | 6 | 1 | 0x61 |
| 2nd | 6 | 5 | 0x65 |
| RIGHT | 0 | 2 | 0x02 |
| Y= | 5 | 4 | 0x54 |
| GRAPH | 4 | 0 | 0x40 |
| + | 1 | 1 | 0x11 |
| 0 | 3 | 0 | 0x30 |

Format: `(group << 4) | key_bit`

**Implementation:** Added to `cpu-runtime.js createExecutor()` — wraps `cpu.read8`/`cpu.write8` to intercept MMIO at 0xE00800-0xE00920 when peripherals include keyboard state. Uses existing `peripherals.keyboard.keyMatrix` for key data.

**Next steps:**
1. Wire keyboard MMIO into browser-shell.html — map PC keyboard → TI-84 key matrix → scan codes
2. Connect _GetCSC (0x03CF7D) to the interrupt controller so the full ISR→scan→result chain works
3. LCD VRAM rendering at 0xE30000+ (LCD controller likely also at 0xE3xxxx, not 0xF0xxxx)

### 2. OS Event Loop Deep Dive

The ISR dispatches to 0x000710 which calls a callback at 0xD02AD7. Currently RAM is zeroed so the callback goes nowhere useful. To make the event loop functional:
- Trace what the real OS boot writes to 0xD02AD7 and surrounding callback table
- Initialize the callback table with proper OS handler addresses
- The event loop at 0x0019BE checks system flags at (IY+offset) and dispatches handlers
- With proper callback table + system flags, execution should reach keyboard scan, LCD refresh, etc.

### 3. Keyboard Input → OS Response Chain

Port 0x01 is wired (returns 0xFF = no keys). Next steps:
- Simulate a key press by setting `peripherals.keyboard.keyMatrix[group]` bits
- Trigger interrupt controller bit 10 (keyboard IRQ)
- Trace the full chain: key press → IRQ → ISR → event loop → keyboard scan routine
- Map PC keyboard to TI-84 key matrix (8 groups × 8 keys)
- Wire into browser-shell.html for interactive input

### 4. LCD Display Buffer

The LCD controller is memory-mapped at 0xF00000+. The OS writes pixel data during boot (TI logo). The browser-shell.html has a 320x240 canvas ready. Modeling the LCD VRAM at the correct memory addresses would render the boot screen.

### 5. CEmu Trace Verification

Compare block-by-block register state against CEmu to find emitter correctness bugs:
- Export CEmu execution trace for first ~100 blocks from reset
- Compare A/F/BC/DE/HL/SP/IX/IY after each block
- Flag mismatches reveal ALU/flag computation errors that silently take wrong branches

### Key Technical Findings

- **ISR gate unlocked (Phase 24A)**: Flash port 0x06 returns 0xD0 (hardware ready status). Boot code reads port 0x06 but only SET bit 2 and write back — never branches on the value. 0xD0 has bit 2 = 0, passing the BIT 2 test, then CP 0xD0 matches.
- **ISR dispatch path**: 0x38 → 0x6F3 (IN0 flash) → 0x704 (CP 0xD0 gate) → 0x710 (callback dispatch) → 0x1713 (call callback) → 0x719 → 0x19BE (event loop)
- **Callback table at 0xD02AD7**: 24-bit pointer to ISR callback handler. Zeroed in our memory → calls 0x000000 (reset). Real OS sets this during init.
- **Handler 0x08C331 is OS init**: 691 steps, 162 blocks across 10 regions. Writes 262K bytes to system RAM, initializes callback table at 0xD02AD7. Heavy in 0x0A0000 (statistics) and 0x050000 regions.
- **ISR cycling is self-modifying**: The callback pointer at 0xD02AD7 evolves across interrupt cycles (0→0x10→0x0040B2). The ISR dispatch system bootstraps itself through repeated interrupt handling. Blocked at missing block 0x00AFF7.
- **Port I/O is 16-bit**: `IN r,(C)` / `OUT (C),r` use full BC register. Interrupt controller (0x5000+), memory controller (0x1000+), LCD controller (0x4000+) all via 16-bit ports.
- **Boot completes in 62 steps**: DI → PLL init → hardware setup → RST 0x08 → init → power-down HALT.
- **MMIO at 0xF00000+**: Not accessed during current execution paths. LCD writes happen later (after key press wake).

---

## Remaining `cpu.unimplemented(...)` Surface

**Zero live stubs** as of Phase 11B. All previously irreducible stubs were fixed:

- `ld (ix+0xFFF9), {1}` at `0x024343` — fixed by doubled-prefix consumption (FD DD → DD wins)
- `ld (ix+0x00E6), {1}` at `0x028298` — same fix
- `Error disassembling ED DD` at `0x070b2b` — fixed by ED NOP fallback for undefined opcodes
- 22 additional stubs discovered at deeper frontier — all fixed via emitter patches (sbc a imm, out (n) a, .sil normalization, nop tag)
